# Example MariaDB config file for medium systems.
#
# This is for a system with little memory (32M - 64M) where MariaDB plays
# an important part, or systems up to 128M where MariaDB is used together with
# other programs (such as a web server)
#
# MariaDB programs look for option files in a set of
# locations which depend on the deployment platform.
# You can copy this option file to one of those
# locations. For information about these locations, do:
# 'my_print_defaults --help' and see what is printed under
# Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
# More information at: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/option-files.html
#
# In this file, you can use all long options that a program supports.
# If you want to know which options a program supports, run the program
# with the "--help" option.

# The following options will be passed to all MariaDB clients
[client]
#password       = your_password
